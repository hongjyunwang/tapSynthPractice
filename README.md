# tapSynthPractice
A simple wavetable synthesizer built with the JUCE framework based on The Audio Programmer's online tutorial. 
Here is the link to the tutorial: https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLLgJJsrdwhPwJimt5vtHtNmu63OucmPck&si=QpyLzJtU1Z_hV7IR
It has simple frequency modulation and ADSR capabilities. 

Looking to add more features to the VST and refine it.
